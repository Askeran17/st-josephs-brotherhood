# The Brotherhood of Saint Joseph

The Brotherhood of Saint Joseph is site which is dedicated to the saint of our days and his disciples. 

On Mount Athos in the first half of the 20th century, a group of people rallied around one monk, united by a common idea: by following a special system of mystical spiritual exercises, to purify one’s thoughts and, having achieved spiritual perfection, to know God.

Elder Joseph, who is also called the Caveman, Hesychast and Silencer, took upon himself the great work of leading these people, with the help of sacred silence, to the gates of the Kingdom of Heaven, contained within each person (Luke 17:21).

## Adaptability on a variety of screen sizes

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Header__

- The header has an adaptive navigation bar on the right. There are three links there: home, advice from the elders and information. The visitor can easily navigate through these links thanks to the responsive bar. Also, in the mobile or medium screen extension version, there will be a “hamburger” icon on the right side of the adaptive panel, which means that the same links are hidden behind it. This is very convenient and allows you to take up less page space.

- On the left side of Headere there is a logo that can be clicked and it will return the visitor to the main page.

## Testing

Throughout the development of the site, I used Google's developer tools to identify and fix any problems along the way.

If something didn't work correctly, I also used Google's developer tools to tweak and fix the problem.

I've thoroughly tested each page using Google Chrome's developer tools to ensure each page is responsive on a variety of screen sizes and devices.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Faskeran17.github.io%2Fst-josephs-brotherhood%2F)

### Unfixed Bugs

On the main page in the section biography of the disciples of St. Joseph, I wanted to enlarge the photographs of the elders in an adaptive design with an extension of 768 pixels and higher. But every time I enlarged the pictures, the text of their biography went somewhere to the side and I didn’t know how to solve this problem. Therefore, the pictures remained in a smaller size than I wanted.

## Credits 

I was inspired by the Love Running project at the Code Institute and took the code from there.

### Content 

- Since there is very little information in the English-language segment about Elder Joseph and his brotherhood, I took information from Russian-language sites (azbyka.ru and pravoslavie.ru). And I translated it into English using Google-translate; I corrected the places in the translation that were inaccurate. I used ready-made text from Russian sites, because the biography, as well as the advice of the elders, needed to be conveyed exactly in the form in which they exist. Therefore, I did not invent these texts myself, but had to convey them to the reader exactly in the form in which they exist.

- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Media

- The images in site I tooke from open source, i.e. google.
