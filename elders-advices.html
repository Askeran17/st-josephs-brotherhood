        <h2>Saint Joseph the Hesychast</h2>
        <br>
        
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “Therefore, I ask you, do not waste this precious evening time, which, if you spend it well in peace and with the fear of God, will bring you much fruit.”</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “For it is dangerous for our soul to speak untruthfully, to judge what we do not know.”</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “As soon as you open your eyes, immediately begin to pray the Jesus Prayer. Don’t let your mind start thinking about everything and only after a while remember that you need to say a prayer. If you force yourself like this, then God will help you. This will become a sacred skill for you - so that prayer, as soon as you open your eyes, will be in your first place all day long. After this, you will work and at the same time say a prayer. Then the work, the mouth, the tongue, the heart, the place, the time will be sanctified and blessed, and above all, the person who pronounces the Name of God.”</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2>Elder Arsenios</h2>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> "By reading the lives of the saints, we receive a double benefit. The first benefit is that the example of their exploits awakens us from the sleep of carelessness. The second is that when we read the lives of the saints with reverence, these saints pray to Christ for us. But always, before you start reading, you need to pray. After prayer, reading the life of the saint brings us to such tenderness that we are no longer able to stop the tears. This happens because prayer enlightens the mind."</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “As long as your legs support you, stand in prayer if you want to see fruit.”</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> "Awoke? Stand up, cross yourself and immediately: Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me."</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2>Saint Ephraim of Katunaki</h2>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “What is from the devil gives rise to a certain coldness, some kind of uncertainty, doubt, and devastates you. You don't have the determination to do anything. So, if you feel inner uncertainty, it means it’s demonic.”</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “When the Lord visits our soul, He wants to find it in prayer. May our soul and our mind not be soaring! This makes God sad. Can we keep ourselves attentive all day? This will help us."</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “Elder Joseph told us that if you go to someone’s house and are in a good spiritual state, you can discern what kind of spirit lives in that house. For example, the spirit of stinginess or lies, greed or something else..."</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2>Elder Joseph of Vatopedi</h2>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “So, do not be afraid of temptation. If you fell, get up. Don't lose your composure. Don't back down. Temptations will pass like clouds.”</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “Don’t be afraid of illnesses, even if you have to suffer all your life.
            The Lord is near, why be embarrassed? We live and move by God. We are in His arms, we breathe in Him. Wherever you turn, wherever you look, the Lord is everywhere: in heaven, on earth, in the abyss, in trees, in stones, in your mind, in your heart. So, doesn’t He see that you are suffering?”</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “Since we do not give work to the mind, the devil captures it in his snare and torments it. Therefore, we must remain in persistent prayer.”</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2>Elder Charalampius</h2>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “What the world has become now is fear and horror. Place your hope only in God and ask Him alone to keep you"</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “Sometimes you feel the need to ask for help in your own words: “To the Savior, Mother of God, come quickly, help me, I’m in danger...”.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> One monk told me that one day while praying, he felt Satan squeezing his heart as if a huge rock had collapsed on his chest. He could not utter the words of prayer either with his lips or with his mind. He tried to cross himself. But at that very moment the enemy tied both his hands so that he could not move them. However, God enlightened him, and with his head he drew a cross in the air. That was enough. Satan immediately freed the monk's arms and chest and became invisible.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Elder Ephraim of Arizona</h2>
        
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> “It is absolutely necessary, as soon as any bad thought gets even a little closer, to drive it out, at the same time making a prayer to the Lord.
            And if we thus reflect thoughts that come from feelings or from the devil, then very soon we will feel the joy and benefit of abstaining from feelings.”</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> As soon as he (i.e. devil) gets ready to whisper something in your ear, you immediately: “Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me” or “save me” - quickly and without stopping, and soon you will see that the thought has weakened or its pressure has weakened, and you won't remember exactly what he was going to tell you.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> When we strive against demonic thoughts, the feat is imputed to us as martyrdom, because a person suffers greatly from evil thoughts, and God, seeing the labor and pain of the soul, imputes this to martyrdom.</p>
