                <h2>Biography by Joseph the Hesychast</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Joseph the Hesychast (Silent Man, worldly name - Frangiskos Kottis) was born on the island of Paros,
                    in the village of Lefke, on November 2, 1897.

                    Frangiskos's parents, Georgios and Maria, were simple workers, but lived a righteous life. They
                    taught all their children to be pious. After Georgios' death in 1907, his widowed wife, Maria, took
                    charge of their upbringing.

                    There were six children and, due to the loss of their breadwinner, the family had to face numerous
                    difficulties.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When Frangiskos was still a small child, God announced to Mary about his future glory through
                    Revelation: the Heavenly messenger who appeared to her then inscribed the name of her son in some
                    mysterious list, after which he took him with him, explaining that it was so pleasing to the
                    Heavenly King.

                    Due to the death of his father and the need to help the family, Frangiskos did not have time to
                    complete the initial course of study at school.

                    In 1914 he went to Piraeus in search of work. Then he was called up for military service. After
                    demobilization, he got a job in Athens. According to some sources, he worked there as a cook, and
                    after some time as a tram conductor. Other evidence suggests that in Athens he was engaged in
                    commercial affairs.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Athos</h3>
                <p> When Frangiskos reached the age of twenty-three, he showed a keen interest in spiritual literature.
                    Inspired by the lives of the saints of God, he began to imitate them to the best of his ability.

                    During this period, in 1921, he met an elder who gave him a number of good advice. Thanks to this
                    acquaintance, Frangiskos's heart was inclined to choose the monastic path.

                    Soon, imitating the example of the holy fathers and the disposition of his own heart, he distributed
                    his estate to the poor and left for Athos.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>Life on Athos </h3>
                <p> Arriving at the Holy Mountain, he expected to meet here many glorious ascetics, whom he had read
                    about in the Lives, but instead he was disappointed. It was partly due to obviously exaggerated
                    expectations, but partly to the decline in the general level of the moral state of the Athonite
                    monks, which was far removed from the level of piety of pilgrims of previous centuries. According to
                    the memoirs of Joseph the Hesychast himself, this situation brought him into a state of mournful
                    crying. </p>

                <br>
                <p>At first, Frangiskos joined the supporters of Elder Daniel of Katunaki, and for some time labored in
                    their brotherhood, but some time later he wished to find a more secluded residence for himself and
                    left the brotherhood.

                    For a long time he was unable to submit himself to obedience to an experienced confessor. After many
                    unsuccessful attempts, relying on God's Providence, Frangiskos indulged in hermitage. Local caves
                    served as his refuge. He earned his living by working: in particular, by making brooms.

                    During his journey through the lands of Athos, Frangiskos met and then became friends with a
                    like-minded person, the monk Arsenios. Soon, taking advantage of the recommendation of Daniel of
                    Katunaki, who reminded them of the role of obedience and cutting off self-will in monastic work,
                    they came under the teaching and obedience of the Albanian elder, Ephraim of Katunaki.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>Monastic feat </h3>
                <p>In 1925, Frangiskos, having overcome the trials of temptation and labor, was awarded tonsure into the
                    great schema with a new name: Joseph.

                    After Elder Ephraim passed away, Joseph assumed all responsibilities for leading and managing the
                    activities of the community.

                    Left without an elder mentor, the brothers in Christ, Arseny and Joseph, continued to wander around
                    the territory of the Holy Mountain. They returned to Kaliva only in winter, but subsequently chose
                    it as their place of permanent residence. </p>

                <br>
                <p>As follows from the confession of Joseph the Hesychast, at this stage of his asceticism he
                    experienced very strong temptations from fallen spirits.

                    One day he contemplated in a vision a formation of monks: soldiers of Christ, preparing to enter
                    into battle with demonic hordes. The military leader leading the monks invited Joseph to take a
                    place among the advanced fighters, which he did. After this incident, the devil launched a fierce,
                    irreconcilable battle against Joseph: he plotted, lying in wait in ambush; the enemy tried to lure
                    him into shackles and nets with shameless deception. But with the help of God, Joseph successfully
                    overcame enemy attacks.
                    This period of struggle lasted about 8 years. </p>

                <br>
                <p>One of the most significant events at this stage of his monastic life was the acquisition of a new
                    mentor, the humble and wise silent man, Daniel, who labored near the Great Lavra, in the cell of St.
                    Peter of Athos.

                    Joseph adopted many positive traits from him. Imitating his ascetic exploits, he accustomed himself
                    to even greater austerity of life, for example, limiting food consumption to one meal a day
                    (Joseph’s diet then consisted of a measure of bread and a few vegetables). With even greater desire,
                    he began to fight his own laziness. </p>

                <br>
                <p> While Joseph the Hesychast asceticised in the monastery of St. Basil the Great, many ascetics
                    rallied around his personality and a monastic brotherhood was formed. Among the other participants
                    in this brotherhood was his blood brother, Athanasius.

                    Gradually the name of Joseph became more and more famous. Many turned to him for advice and
                    admonitions. Joseph willingly shared his wealth of knowledge, but the crowds associated with
                    incessant visits violated the solitary nature of his personal life and the lives of his brothers. As
                    a result, he was forced to think about looking for a new place.

                    In 1929-30, Elder Joseph left Athos for some time to tonsure his own mother as a monk and found a
                    nunnery in the Drama region.

                    Returning to the Holy Mountain, he did not break off contact with the nuns he had tonsured and
                    continued to instruct them through regular correspondence.</p>

                <br>
                <p>In 1938, Joseph the Hesychast, together with the monk Arseny, drew attention to one abandoned kaliva
                    and chose it as the next place for ascetic deeds. Kalyva was located in the Small Skete of St. Anna,
                    in caves under a mountain cliff.

                    From available materials, clay and wood, the brethren built themselves a modest hut, which included
                    three small rooms, cells. One of them was intended for Joseph, the other for his comrade-in-arms,
                    Arseny. The third was used by the hieromonk who visited them. In addition, the brethren restored the
                    Church of St. John the Baptist on that site.

                    They labored in kaliva for 30 years. Initially, they prayed and worked together. Both the lack of
                    space for living quarters and the not entirely convenient location of the kaliva had an impact.
                    Subsequently, other ascetics began to join them, mainly young monks. The brotherhood grew.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Over time, Elder Joseph decided to move closer to the coastline. The Kaliva of the Holy
                    Unmercenaries, located in the New Skete, was chosen as an alternative residence.

                    In 1958, Father Joseph suffered from a serious illness. First, a dangerous abscess formed on his
                    neck. He then suffered from heart failure. At first, he did not agree to undergo a course of
                    treatment - he did not want to tear himself away from his monastic deeds - but then, yielding to the
                    persuasion of his spiritual students, he agreed.

                    He felt the approach of death in advance. Shortly before his death, on the Day of the Dormition of
                    the Mother of God, he received communion of the Holy Mysteries of Christ.</p>

                <br>
                <p>On August 15, 1959, the ascetic’s heart stopped.

                    On March 9, 2020, the Patriarchate of Constantinople canonized him as a saint with the establishment
                    of his memory on August 16.</p>

                <p>Father Arsenios Hesychast (Galanopoulos; 1886–1983) is an Athonite elder who acquired the gifts of
                    spiritual
                    reasoning, humility and meekness, insight and unceasing prayer. For almost forty years, Father
                    Arseny was an
                    inseparable companion, spiritual brother and companion of the great elder Reverend Joseph the
                    Hesychast
                    (1897–1959). Elder Arsenios reposed in the Lord on September 15, 1983.</p>

                <p>Elder Hieroschemamonk Ephraim Katunaksky (Papanikitas; 1912–1998) - disciple
                    of Elder Joseph the Hesychast, ascetic of Holy Mount Athos. During his
                    lifetime, he became widely known as the continuer of the ancient ascetic
                    tradition of hesychast prayer. Father Ephraim lived on the Holy Mountain for
                    sixty-five years (of which forty-two years were as a novice) and glorified
                    holy obedience throughout his life. Elder Ephraim reposed in the Lord on February 27, 1998.</p>

                <p>Elder Schemamonk Joseph was born in 1921 on the island of Cyprus into a
                    large peasant family. He was a disciple of Elder Joseph the Hesychast.

                    Elder Joseph reposed in the Lord at dawn on July 1, 2009. An hour and a half after the death of
                    Elder Joseph, a
                    miracle happened: when the monks revealed the elder’s face for the last time, everyone witnessed the
                    blissful smile
                    that appeared on the lips of the ascetic. The deceased smiled, thereby “effectively capturing the
                    evidence of the
                    general resurrection,” according to the rector of Vatopedi, Archimandrite Ephraim.</p>

                <p>Elder Charalampius was born in 1910 into a family of pious parents. From a young age, he was

                    by
                    God for the strength of his faith and was awarded the salvation of his life by the miraculous
                    appearance of St.
                    George the Victorious during Bulgarian captivity. Together with his parents, Charalampius
                    experienced to the

                    the bitterness of the Turkish genocide, the misfortunes of war, the hardships of forced emigration

                <h3>Elder Ephraim of Arizona</h3>
                <div id="elder-ephraim-of-arizona-bg"></div>
                <p>Father Ephraim is a spiritual child, novice and companion of Elder Joseph the Hesychast, who was able
                    to fully
                    perceive the rich spiritual experience of his great teacher.

                    The Lord called Father Ephraim to the path of monasticism in his youth and from the very beginning
                    in a special
                    way
                    testified to His care for this newly chosen warrior of Christ. “I was nineteen years old,” the elder
                    writes in
                    his
                    memoirs, “when I set out on the path to the inheritance of the Mother of God, to the Holy Mountain.
                    This path to
                    monastic life was shown to me by my virtuous and monastic-loving mother, now nun Feofania.”

                    Next to his mentor, Father Ephraim spent twelve years - as long as Father Joseph had lived since
                    their first
                    meeting
                    - literally absorbing his teachings and instructions. The Lord vouchsafed the novice to serve his
                    geronda until
                    his
                    very last breath.

                    By special instructions from God, Father Ephraim moved to the USA, where in the state of Arizona, in
                    the desert,
                    he founded a monastery in honor of St. Anthony the Great. In total, there are twenty monasteries
                    under his care
                    in
                    America and Canada today. Elder Ephraim reposed in the Lord on December 7, 2019.</p>
